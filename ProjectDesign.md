MVP: 
* one default user, one keyboard choice
* Lessons are stored in files
* Lessons are gonna be interpreted as arrays of letters, including white space, and user's input would be cross checked against lessons one letter at a time
* Lesson design - look up words that only consist provided letters and store them as the lesson pool. Use shuffle to randomize the lessons, so they differ every time.
* Do I need promise? - promises are used when making request to servers, so perhaps when loading lesson.
* MVC pattern
